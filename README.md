# Cartesian Pen Plotter  

The goal of this project is to create a 2D XY pen plotter with two brushless DC motors and an ESP32 microcontroller. 
The primary goal is to establish an automated system capable of accurately reproducing a Nikolas House design. Through the integration of contemporary technology, we aim to 
streamline the intricate drawing process, introducing automation to enhance precision.  

The primary task of the XY Pen Plotter is to draw the Nikolas House in a continuous linear motion without lifting the pen. The construction of the Nikolas House follows the guidelines provided in the diagram.

- User Interface:
    
  Established a wireless (Wi-Fi) connection between the mobile app and the ESP32 Thing Plus controller for the pen plotter.
  The mobile app and Wi-Fi connection facilitate user-friendly control of the pen plotter, simplifying the creation of the Nikolas House design.
